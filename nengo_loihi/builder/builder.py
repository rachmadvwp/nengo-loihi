    """The data structure for the chip/simulator.

    This is a subclass of CxModel, which defines methods for adding ensembles,
    discretizing, and tracking the simulator. This class handles build
    functions and keeping track of chip/host communication.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dt : float, optional (Default: 0.001)
        The length of a simulator timestep, in seconds.
    label : str, optional (Default: None)
        A name or description to differentiate models.
    builder : Builder, optional (Default: None)
        A `.Builder` instance to keep track of build functions.
        If None, the default builder will be used.

    Attributes
    ----------
    builder : Builder
        The build functions used by this model.
    dt : float
        The length of a simulator timestep, in seconds.
    label : str or None
        A name or description to differentiate models.
    objs : dict
        Dictionary mapping from Nengo objects to Nengo Loihi objects.
    params : dict
        Mapping from objects to namedtuples containing parameters generated
        in the build process.
    probes : list
        List of all probes. Probes must be added to this list in the build
        process, as this list is used by Simulator.
    seeded : dict
        All objects are assigned a seed, whether the user defined the seed
        or it was automatically generated. 'seeded' keeps track of whether
        the seed is user-defined. We consider the seed to be user-defined
        if it was set directly on the object, or if a seed was set on the
        network in which the object resides, or if a seed was set on any
        ancestor network of the network in which the object resides.
    seeds : dict
        Mapping from objects to the integer seed assigned to that object.
